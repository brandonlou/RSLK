kP: 0.0008
kD: 0.0005

This kP value had a slight oscillation over a long-ish period. The kD value helped to dampen it out. Higher kD values caused even more oscillation.

kP = 0.006,
kI = 0.00000000001,
kD = 0.00055;

Increasing kP by a lot helped the RSLK match the curves of the ribbon track. The integral term smoothed it out just a tiny bit. Increasing kI would increase the jitteyness.
